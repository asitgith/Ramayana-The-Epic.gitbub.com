        <p>Considered by several scholars to be an interpolation to the original six chapters, this kanda narrates
            Rama's reign of Ayodhya, the birth of Lava and Kusha, the Ashvamedha yajna, and last days of Rama. At the
            expiration of his term of exile, Rama returns to Ayodhya with Sita, Lakshmana, and Hanuman, where the
            coronation is performed. On being asked to prove his devotion to Rama, Hanuman tears his chest open and to
            everyone's surprise, there is an image of Rama and Sita inside his chest. Rama rules Ayodhya and the reign
            is called Rama-Rajya (a place where the common folk is happy, fulfilled, and satisfied).
            After hearing from his ministers that his subjects were unhappy with the fact that their king had chosen to
            recouncile with a woman who had lived in the house of another man, Rama is furious as Sita had proved to
            everyone she was pure through the agnipariksha. In order to uphold his rank as the champion of dharma, Sita,
            who was pregnant was sent to exile into the forest.She finds refuge in Sage Valmiki's ashram, where she
            gives birth to twin boys, Lava and Kusha. Meanwhile, Rama conducts an Ashvamedha yajna (A Vedic, royal
            assertion of sovereignty) and in absence of Sita, places a golden statue of her.
            Lava and Kusha capture the horse (the vehicle of the yajna), and defeat the whole army of Ayodhya that had
            accompanied the horse. Later on, the brothers defeat Lakshmana, Bharata, Shatrughna, and other warriors and
            take Hanuman as prisoner. Finally, Rama himself arrives and defeats the two mighty brothers. Valmiki updates
            Sita about this development and advises both the brothers to go to Ayodhya and tell the story of Sita's
            sacrifice to the common folk. Both brothers arrive at Ayodhya, but face many difficulties while convincing
            the people. Hanuman helps both the brothers in this task.
            At some point, Valmiki brings Sita forward. Seeing Sita, Rama is teary-eyed and realises that Lava and Kusha
            are his own sons. Nagarasen (one of the ministers who instigated the hatred towards Sita) challenges Sita's
            character and asks her to prove her purity. Sita is overwhelmed with emotion, and decides to go back to the
            Earth from where she emerged. She says that, "If I am pure, this earth will open and swallow me whole."
            At that very moment, the earth opens up and swallows Sita. Rama rules Ayodhya for many years and finally
            takes Samadhi into Sarayu river along with his three brothers and leaves the world. He goes back to
            Vaikuntha in his Vishnu form (Lakshmana as Adishesha, Bharata as his conch, and Shatrughana as the
            Sudarshana Chakra) and meets Sita there, who by then had assumed her true form of Lakshmi.</p>
